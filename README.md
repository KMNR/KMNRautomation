# KMNR Ultimate Music Machine

The KMNR Ultimate Music Machine was created to replace the previous automation system for KMNR radio station's DJs and employees. This is because the old system was outdated, difficult to maintain, and hard to use. We created this syetem based off the previous one with an updated front and backend, plus a few new, useful features.
